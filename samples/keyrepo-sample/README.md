### Key repository sample (Consumer API)

In this example, an encryption key reference is stored in the record payload.
The encryption key is generated by (and stored in) the key repository. Two records with the same record's key embed the
same encryption key reference. The key repository in this example is a simple in memory repository but it would be a
key vault such as Google Cloud KMS or Hashicorp Vault in a real world example.

#### Running the sample

    cd samples/kafka-encryption-keyrepo-sample
    mvn package
    docker-compose up # on windows and OSX, you need to adjust
    sh runSamples.sh
